# GeneticAlgorithmCPP
Genetic algorithm programmed in C++ using raw pointers. In practice smart pointers are better to use but just for some practice I decided to use raw pointers.

## Note ##
This algorithm is not perfect and there are many vectors than can affect the outcome and/or the performance.
For instance the mutation chance of 1% might be too high, or the population size might be too low/high.
Besides, there are different methods of selection and crossover.

Tweaking these vectors is key to good outcome and/or performance.

In this example the goal of the algorithm was to guess a string of characters. This is just to demonstrate the function of the genetic algorithm.
If you want to use this algorithm for your own use you can simply substitute the individual's gene by your own object. Do not forget to change the way fitness is calculated and how mutation is implemented.
